Hello there,

Is there any Possibility to add the Nucleo 144 (STM32f429ZI) to the Sloeber IDE?
I know that the Arduino Supported Boards can be easily added in the Arduino IDE and Sloeber also have some of them.
Can somebody tell me how long it will take that the Nucleo 144 is added to Sloeber or where i can find something to add it manual?

Thanks for your answers
